I am a fifth-year Ph.D student in system group at the department of computer science, the University of Chicago. I am working with Prof. [Shan Lu](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu) on the performance and the scalability problems of
data processing and data analytics systems. Here is my [resume]({{ site.url }}/jw_cv_long.pdf).
